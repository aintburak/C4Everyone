# Enumeration in cpp

In C++, an enum (short for "enumeration") is a user-defined type that represents a set of named values. Enums are typically used to represent a fixed set of possible values, such as the days of the week or the months of the year.

```cpp

enum DayOfWeek {
  Monday,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday,
  Saturday,
  Sunday
};

DayOfWeek today = Wednesday;
if (today == Wednesday) {
  cout << "Today is Wednesday!" << endl;
}
```

In the example above, we define an enum called DayOfWeek that represents the seven days of the week. The names of the enum values (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.) are all implicitly assigned integer values starting from 0 (i.e. Monday has a value of 0, Tuesday has a value of 1, and so on).

We then declare a variable called today of type DayOfWeek and assign it the value Wednesday. We can then use this variable in an if statement to check whether it is equal to Wednesday.


```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
  enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
  };

  void setColor(Color newColor) {
    color_ = newColor;
  }

  Color getColor() const {
    return color_;
  }

private:
  Color color_;
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj;
  obj.setColor(MyClass::Red);
  cout << "Color is: " << obj.getColor() << endl; // Output: Color is: 0
  return 0;
}

```


## Behind The Scenes 

An enum in C++ is implemented as a set of named integer constants. Each named value in the enum is assigned an underlying integer value that starts at 0 for the first named value, and increments by 1 for each subsequent named value. However, you can also explicitly assign integer values to named values in the enum if you want to specify their underlying integer values explicitly.



```cpp
enum Color {
  Red,    // assigned the value 0
  Green,  // assigned the value 1
  Blue    // assigned the value 2
};
```

In the example above, the Color enum is defined with three named values (Red, Green, and Blue). Since no explicit integer values are assigned, the compiler will automatically assign integer values to each named value, starting with Red at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent value.

So, behind the scenes, the Color enum is actually implemented like this:


```cpp
const int Red = 0;
const int Green = 1;
const int Blue = 2;
```

When you use an enum in your code, the named values are substituted with their corresponding integer values at compile time. For example, if you write Color myColor = Red, the compiler will replace Red with its corresponding integer value of 0, so the resulting code will be Color myColor = 0;.

 

```cpp
enum Color {
  Red,    // assigned the value 0
  Green,  // assigned the value 1
  Blue    // assigned the value 2
};

int main() {
  Color myColor = Green;
  return 0;
}
```

When we compiled, this code might generate the following assembly code:


```assembly
main:
    push    ebp
    mov     ebp, esp
    sub     esp, 4
    mov     DWORD PTR [ebp-4], 1   ; Set myColor to 1 (Green)
    mov     eax, 0
    leave
    ret
```

In this assembly code, you can see that the value of myColor is set to 1 (the integer value corresponding to the Green constant in the Color enum) using the mov instruction with the immediate value 1. This shows that, at the machine level, enums in C++ are represented as integers with values corresponding to the named constants in the enum.

Note that the exact machine code generated by a C++ compiler can vary depending on the platform, compiler, and optimization settings used,so the result might changed depending on the which ide you use such as VSCode, VisualStudio, Devcpp etc.

Overall, enums provide a convenient way to assign names to integer constants, which can make your code more readable and easier to understand.
