# 🎯 Cpp-Playlist Challenge 2: Automated Grader 📝
Welcome to Section 19's Challenge 2 - Automated Grader for C++ enthusiasts and kitty lover 🐱! 


# 🚀Overview
In this exciting challenge, we will create a C++ program that reads a file named 'responses.txt.' This file contains the answer key for a quiz and student responses to the quiz. The answer key is the first item in the file, followed by a list of students' names and their corresponding quiz responses.

Sample 'responses.txt'
Here's a sample 'responses.txt' file to give you an idea of the format:

```
ABCDE                  
Frank                     
ABCDE                  
Larry
ABCAC
Moe
BBCDE
Curly
BBAAE
Michael
BBCDE
```
## 🐱 The Mission
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read the file and display the following information:

* Each student's name and their score (number of correct answers out of 5)
* At the end, calculate and display the class average

## Expected Output
Your program should output to the console the following:

```markdown
Student                     Score 
----------------------------

Frank                     5
Larry                     3
Moe                       4
Curly                     2
Michael                   4

---------------------------
Average score            3.6
```
## 📝 Assumptions
You can assume that the data in the file is properly formatted.

## 💡 Getting Started
* Make sure you have a C++ development environment set up.
* Download the `responses.txt` file (or create your own) to test your program.
