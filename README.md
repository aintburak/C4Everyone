## üèóÔ∏è What is C++ ?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was created as an extension of the C programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. C++ is designed with a focus on system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications, while also providing features for general-purpose programming.

Key features of C++ include:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports the principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This allows developers to structure code in a way that models real-world entities and relationships.

* Low-Level Manipulation: Like C, C++ provides low-level programming features such as pointers and manual memory management, making it suitable for systems programming and tasks where fine control over hardware resources is required.

* Standard Template Library (STL): C++ includes a powerful library known as the Standard Template Library, which provides a collection of generic classes and functions with templates. It includes data structures, algorithms, and other utilities that help in writing efficient and reusable code.

* Performance: C++ allows for direct manipulation of memory, which can lead to highly efficient code. It's often used in applications where performance is critical, such as game development, real-time systems, and high-performance computing.

* Portability: C++ programs can be written to be highly portable across different platforms. This is particularly important for software that needs to run on various operating systems and hardware architectures.

* Versatility: C++ is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, including system software, game development, embedded systems, web development, and more.

C++ has gone through several standardizations over the years, with each version introducing new features and improvements. The most recent major version is C++20, which was released in 2020. The C++ standards committee continues to work on future versions to enhance the language and address the evolving needs of developers.

## :mag: What is C Programming Language ?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.

## :european_castle:  History of C Language 

C is an imperative language designed to compile relatively straightforwardly, which provides low-level memory access. With the gradual increase in the program's popularity, the vocabulary and its compiler have become available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

Several features have been included in the C language with the introduction of the K&R C language (a new edition of C published in 1978 by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie).

* C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M.Ritchie and Ken Thompson to develop the UNIX operating system at AT&T Bell Labs.
* C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972 and was developed in assembly language.
* The language was named ‚ÄúC‚Äù because its features were derived from ‚ÄúB‚Äù, which according to Ken Thompson was a stripped-down version of the type less BCPL programming language.
* In 1977, Oracle database development started, and in 1983 its code was rewritten from assembly to C. It became one in all the foremost widespread databases within the world.
* In 1989 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) committe published a standard for C (generally called ‚ÄúANSI C‚Äù)

## :wrench: How C Programming Language Works?

C is a compiled programming language. This means that we need to convert our source files (human-readable text files) into object files (which can be understood by the machine: microcontroller, computer/laptop).


![](https://i.imgur.com/NGh0OEJ.png)


Developing software using the C programming language involves several tasks/phases. To successfully create an application/program, we need to have an editor, a compiler, a linker, and a loader. Most of the IDE (e.g., Code Blocks, Eclipse, Geany, etc.) for C programming provide all these necessary tools.

The process of developing an application in C is described in the picture below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/CqRshCw.png)



* **Editing**: Editing or writing source code containing all the instructions that need to be executed by the machine in a text format (understandable by humans) is the first step of developing an application by a plain text editor (Notepad etc.) or the editor provided by the **IDE** (Integrated development environment). The source code must be in C language syntax and saved as a .c file.
* **Compiling**: If we want to use a simple text editor for the source code, we need to install a **C compiler**. The compilation task contains the initial phase, which is known as preprocessing. A preprocessor invoked by the compiler executes the preprocessing. The preprocessor goes over the source for all the lines starting with the `#` (hash) key called compiler directives.

    One of the compiler's directives includes external functions from our source code. The **preprocessor** removes all the compiler directives from the source code but remembers what additional files need to be included later in the process. A temporary file will be created at the end of the preprocessing, which is not visible to the user.

    After the preprocessing, the compiler converts our source file into an *object* file. The object file is also named machine code. It can be interpreted by the computer's Central Processing Unit or microcontroller.
    
    The object file is ready, but some undefined references are missing. These vague references are pieces of code that must be retrieved from another place. In our case, the undefined reference is the `printf()` function. We know where to get the code for this function because the compiler directive specified it (`#include<stdio.h>`).

    `stdio.h` is a *header* file (extension `.h`) which includes the declaration of `printf()` function. We can specify where to find the definition of the `printf()` function by including the header file.
* **Linking**: Both Object files and ***Static library*** files for the external functions are needed. The *static library* files (`.lib`) contain the definition of the external functions used in our source file. In our particular case, the static library file will have the machine code of the `printf()` function.

    A ***linker*** performs the linking. It will search all the object files and replace all the undefined references with the referenced machine code within the library files. We will have an **executable file** at the end of the linking process (e.g., `.exe` for Windows applications, `.hex` for microcontrollers).

* **Loading**: A ***loader*** performs that loading the program file into the computer‚Äôs memory. Usually, the link will include the loader in the executable file. When we run the executable, it will trigger the loader, which will load the program into the memory and begin the execution.

## :memo:Syntax

### Character set
Tthe basic C reference character set includes the following:
* Lowercase and uppercase letters of ISO Basic Latin Alphabet: `a`‚Äì`z` `A`‚Äì`Z`
* Decimal digits: `0`‚Äì`9`
* Graphic characters: `! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~`
* [Whitespace character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character)

 


### Keywords
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming with special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax, and they cannot be used as an identifier. 
```c
int rabbit;
```
Here, `int` is a keyword that indicates `rabbit` which is a variable of type integer. Here is the list of keywords allowed in ANSI C.

## :deciduous_tree: Operators 

### Arithmetic Operators

An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations on numerical values such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.



| Operator | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| +     | addition or unary plus     |
| -     | subtraction or unary minus     | 
| *     | multiplication     |
| /     | Divides numerator by de-numerator.|
| %     | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.|

### Logical Operators
An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decission making in C programming.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| &&     | Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, the condition becomes true(1).     | If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.     |
| ll     | Called OR Operator, If any of the two operands are non-zero, the condition becomes true (1).     | If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.     |
| !     | It is called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true (1), the Logical NOT operator will make it false (0).     | If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.     |



### Assignment Operators

An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable.


| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| =     | The most common and simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand     | x = y     |
| +=     | It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand.     | x = x+y     |
| -=     | It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.     | x = x-y     |
| *=   | It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.     | x = x*y     |
| /=     | It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.     | x = x/y     |
| %=     | It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.     | x = x%y     |


### Relational Operators


| Operator | Description |
| -------- | -------- | 
| ==     | If the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.     | 
| !=     | Checking that if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.     | 
| >     | Suppose the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.    | 
| <     | Let's say the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.     | 
| >=     | If the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.     | 
| <=    | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If no, then the condition becomes false.     |

### Bitwise Operators

During computation, mathematical operations are converted to bit-level, making processing faster and saving power. They are used in C programming to perform bit-level operations.



| Operator | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|    &      |    Bitwise AND      |
|    l      |     Bitwise OR     |
|    ^     |    Bitwise exclusive OR      |
|    ~     |    Bitwise complement      |
|    <<      |    Shift left      |
|     >>	     |   Shift right       |


> :bulb: Bitwise operator perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for the operators.


| p   | q   | p & q | p l q | p ^ q |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 0     | 1     | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 1     | 1     | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 0     | 1     | 1     |

### Misc Operators



| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|     sizeof()     |   Gives the size of a variable.       |        sizeof(int) = 4  |
|      &    |  (Ampersand) Returns adress of the variable. In other words, the answer of "where is the variable stored?"        |   &x; gives the actual address of the variable.       |
|     *     |   Pointer to a variable.       |    *c;      |
| ? :     | 	Conditional Expression.     | If Condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y     |

## :floppy_disk:Memory management

### Memory Management in C++

Memory management in C++ involves allocating and deallocating memory for variables and data structures during program execution. C++ provides both manual and automatic memory management mechanisms. Here are the key aspects of memory management in C++:

### 1. Stack Memory:
Automatic Variables: Variables declared inside a function are typically allocated on the stack. They are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.

```cpp
void exampleFunction() {
    int localVar = 10;  // localVar is allocated on the stack
}  // localVar is automatically deallocated when the function exits
```

### 2. Heap Memory:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: C++ provides operators new and delete for dynamic memory allocation on the heap. The new operator allocates memory, and the delete operator deallocates it.

```cpp
int* dynamicVar = new int;    // Allocates memory on the heap
delete dynamicVar;            // Deallocates memory
```
### 3. Smart Pointers:
std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr: These smart pointers manage memory automatically and help prevent memory leaks. std::unique_ptr is used when ownership is unique, while std::shared_ptr is used when multiple pointers share ownership.

```cpp
#include <memory>

std::unique_ptr<int> uniqueVar = std::make_unique<int>(42);
std::shared_ptr<int> sharedVar = std::make_shared<int>(42);
```

### 4. Memory Leak Prevention:
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): It is a C++ programming technique that binds the lifecycle of a resource to the scope of an object.

```cpp
class MyResource {
public:
    MyResource() { /* Acquire resource */ }
    ~MyResource() { /* Release resource */ }
};

void exampleFunction() {
    MyResource resource;  // Resource is automatically released when 'resource' goes out of scope
}
```

### 5. Array Memory Management:
Arrays with new and delete: If you need to allocate memory for an array dynamically, use new[] and delete[].

```cpp
int* dynamicArray = new int[5];   // Allocates an array of 5 integers on the heap
delete[] dynamicArray;            // Deallocates the array
```
### 6. Memory Management Best Practices:
Avoid Manual Memory Management When Possible: Use smart pointers and standard containers to manage memory automatically.

- **Always Free Dynamically Allocated Memory:** To prevent memory leaks, ensure that memory allocated with new is deallocated with `delete` or `delete[]`.

- **Prefer Stack Allocation:** Use the stack for short-lived variables, and the heap for dynamic data with longer lifetimes.

- **Be Cautious with Pointers:** Avoid using raw pointers when possible. If necessary, use smart pointers to manage ownership and lifetimes.

C++ provides a flexible and powerful memory management system, but it requires developers to be mindful of memory allocation and deallocation to prevent issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers. Smart pointers and RAII principles are crucial for effective and safe memory management in modern C++ code.

### Memory Management in C
One of the essential functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing memory and the objects stored in memory. C provides three distinct ways to allocate memory for objects:
1. Static memory allocation
2. Dynamic memory allocation
3. Automatic memory allocation

### Static Memory Allocation

In Static Memory Allocation, the memory for your data is allocated when the program starts. The size is fixed when the program is created. It applies to global variables file scope variables and is qualified with statically defined inside functions. Each static or global variable defines one block of space of a fixed size. The area is allocated once your program starts (part of the exec operation) and is never freed. This memory allocation is set and cannot be changed, i.e., increased or decreased after allocation. Example as following for static memory allocation:

```c
    int b; 
    int c[10]; 
    char x;  
```
### Dynamic Memory Allocation

The concept of dynamic memory allocation in c language allows users to allocate memory at runtime. Dynamic memory allocation is possible by four functions already defined in stdlib.h header file.

- `malloc()`
- `calloc()`
- `realloc()`
- `free()`

#### `malloc()`
The name "malloc" stands for *memory allocation*.

The `malloc()` function reserves a block of memory of the specified number of bytes. It gives a pointer of void which can be casted into pointers of any form.

**Syntax**

```c
pointer = (castType*) malloc(size);
```

#### `calloc()`
The `calloc()` function allocates multiple blocks of requested memory. It initializes all bytes to zero. It returns `NULL` if memory is not sufficient.

##### **Syntax**

```c
pointer = (castType*) calloc(number, byte-size)  
```

#### `realloc()`

If the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient or more than required, we can change the size of previously allocated memory using the `realloc()` function.


#####  **Syntax**

```c
pointer = realloc(pointer, newsize)  
```

#### `free()`
Dynamically allocated memory created with either `calloc()` or `malloc()` is not freed independently. You must explicitly use `free()` to release the space.

##### **Syntax**

```c
free(pointer);  
```


### Automatic Memory Allocation

Automatic allocation happens when you declare an automatic variable, such as a function argument or a local variable. An automatic variable is allocated when the compound statement containing the declaration is entered and freed when that compound statement is exited.
