# `%i` and `%d` Decimal Formatters

This document provides an overview of the `%i` and `%d` format specifiers in C programming, especially focusing on their behavior in different contexts.

## Overview

In C programming, `%d` and `%i` are used as format specifiers for integers. While they may seem interchangeable, they have subtle differences, especially when used with input functions like `scanf()`.

### `%d` Format Specifier

- **Usage**: The `%d` specifier is used to format integer values as signed decimal integers. This means it can take both positive and negative values.
- **Behavior with `scanf()`**: When used with `scanf()`, the `%d` specifier assumes that the input is in base 10. If the input is in a format other than decimal (like octal or hexadecimal), it might lead to unexpected results.
  - **Example**: If the input provided is `012`, it is treated as `12` because `%d` ignores the leading zero and assumes the input is in base 10.

### `%i` Format Specifier

- **Usage**: The `%i` specifier formats integer values as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal integers, based on the format of the provided input.
- **Behavior with `scanf()`**: Unlike `%d`, `%i` auto-detects the base of the provided input. This makes it versatile for reading different numeric formats directly.
  - **Decimal input**: Just provide the number (e.g., `12`).
  - **Octal input**: Precede the value with `0` (e.g., `014` is octal for `12`).
  - **Hexadecimal input**: Precede the value with `0x` or `0X` (e.g., `0xC` is hexadecimal for `12`).
  
  - **Example**: If the input is `012`, `%i` interprets it as `10` in decimal because it treats the input as an octal number (base 8).

## Conclusion

The choice between `%d` and `%i` depends on the specific needs of the application. When precision and specificity in numeric input are required, `%i` offers flexibility by automatically detecting the input base. However, for strictly decimal inputs, `%d` is straightforward and reliable.
