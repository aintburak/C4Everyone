# Generic Programming with Macros and Templates
Hey there! ðŸŒŸ This repository provides an introduction to generic programming in C and C++ using macros and templates. We illustrate how to create a generic MAX function that can find the maximum of two values for different data types.

## C Macro Example
generic_max_c.c
In C, we can use macros to achieve a degree of generic programming. The MAX macro allows us to compare two values and return the greater of the two. This macro works with various data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX(a, b) ((a > b) ? a : b)

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 8;
    float float1 = 3.14;
    float float2 = 2.71;

    int maxInt = MAX(num1, num2);
    float maxFloat = MAX(float1, float2);

    printf("Max integer: %d\n", maxInt);
    printf("Max float: %f\n", maxFloat);

    return 0;
}
```

## C++ Template Example
generic_max_cpp.cpp
In C++, we can achieve generic programming more safely using templates. The max template function works with any data type that supports the comparison operator, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or custom types with defined comparison operators.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
T max(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 8;
    float float1 = 3.14;
    float float2 = 2.71;

    int maxInt = max(num1, num2);
    float maxFloat = max(float1, float2);

    std::cout << "Max integer: " << maxInt << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max float: " << maxFloat << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Using templates in C++ is recommended over macros for generic programming because it provides type safety and better error checking at compile time.
