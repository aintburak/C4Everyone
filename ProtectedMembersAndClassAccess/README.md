# 🌟 All About C++ - Protected Members and Class Access 🌟

Hey there, fellow code explorer! Welcome to the exciting world of C++ where we're going to dive into the secrets of "Protected Members and Class Access." 🚀

This code example explores how C++ handles access to different class members, like public, protected, and private ones. And guess what? We've got emojis to make it all the more fun! 😄🎉

## 👩‍💻 Let's Get Started

In this code, we have two special classes: `Base` and `Derived`. These classes are like family members, with one being the parent (Base) and the other the child (Derived). 🧒👩‍👩‍👧‍👦

### 🌞 The Base Class

In our `Base` class, we have three members:
- `a` 🟢 (public) - Everyone can see it!
- `b` 🔵 (protected) - A bit more private, but family and friends can still peek.
- `c` 🔴 (private) - Super-duper secret! Only `Base` knows about it! Shhh... 🤫

### 🌈 The Derived Class

Then comes our `Derived` class, which is like the child inheriting from the parent, but with some rules:

- `a` 🟢 - Still public! It's like a family heirloom passed down.
- `b` 🔵 - Now it's protected, but it's kind of like the family's trust fund.
- `c` 🔴 - Sorry, not invited to the party! It's still a secret.

### 👋 Fun Interactions

In our `main()` function, we play around with these classes, testing who can access what.

- Accessing members from a `Base` object is like hanging out with the family members.
- Accessing members from a `Derived` object is like being part of the family but with some extra perks.

📢 **Hint**: Some lines of code are commented out, but you can uncomment them and see what happens!

## 🏁 Ready, Set, Go!

This code is your playground to understand how C++ handles the family relationships between classes and their members. So, fire up your compiler and start experimenting!

And remember, in the world of C++, the family matters, and so does the access to their secrets! Have fun exploring! 🎈🎈

Thank youu for reading! 🚀👩‍💻

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Base {
    // Note friends of Base have access to all 
public:
    int a {0};
    void display() { std::cout << a << ", " << b << ", " << c << endl; } // member method has access to all
protected:
    int b {0};
private:
    int c {0};
};

class Derived: public Base {
    // Note friends of Derived have access to only what Derived has access to

    // a will be public
    // b will be protected
    // c will not be accessible
public:
    void access_base_members() {
        a = 100;    // OK
        b = 200;    // OK
     //   c = 300;    // not accessible
    }
    
};

int main() {
    
    cout << "=== Base member access from base objects ===========" << endl;
    Base base;
    base.a = 100;   // OK
//    base.b = 200;   // Compiler Error
//    base.c = 300;   // Compiler Error
    
    cout << "=== Base member access from derived objects ===========" << endl;
    Derived d;
    d.a = 100;  // OK
//    d.b = 200;  // Compiler Error
//    d.c = 300;  // Compiler Error
    return 0;
}
```
